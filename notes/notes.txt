Do cover page, template is on Blackboard.

What we have so far is good as notes but needs expanding upon quite a bit more.

Organise differently (low priority, can be done last minute).

Read a paper on the elliptic fourier transform and add as an example to the report.

Something about eigenvalues (depends on number of terms).

Extracting a profile out of the image (chapter 3).

Check Danilo's website (does something similar for leaves).

Invaginations can be an issue if the curve isn't a strict function.

Make sure that the way the data is collected is well reported.

Try to reproduce the results of a paper.

Add more comments to the code.

Try to add code snippets to the document body. Actually pseudocode is better (try to find some pseudocode in a paper for reference).

Talk about code libraries.

Try to be more exact with the mathematics (lemmas, theorems, etc.). Find something rigourous for the elliptic Fourier.
