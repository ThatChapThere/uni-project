## About

This repository is for my third year project, *Mathematical Methods in Morphometry: The Mathematical Description of Complex Natural Shapes*.

## Code

I created a program that can generate any waveform created by a sum of sines. You could acomplish this by
editing the following lines in [drawing_area.cpp](code/elliptic_fourier/drawing_area.cpp):

```cpp
double freqs[] = {1, 1.1, 0.8};
double mags[] = {1, 1.1, 0.8};
```

We now have a radial version of this working:

Elliptical Fourier analysis is now implemented:

### Todo:

* ~~Make this generate images that can be analysed.~~
* ~~Make the fourier analysis side of the code.~~
* ~~Make this work elliptically instead of just linearly.~~

## Report

Steady progress is being made on the report, but references are still a little lacking.
