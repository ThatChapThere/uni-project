## About

This repository is for my third year project, *Mathematical Methods in Morphometry: The Mathematical Description of Complex Natural Shapes*.

## Code

So far I have created a program that can generate any waveform created by a sum of sines. You can acomplish this by
editing the following lines in [drawing_area.cpp](code/elliptic_fourier/drawing_area.cpp).

```cpp
double freqs[] = {1, 1.1, 0.8};
double mags[] = {1, 1.1, 0.8};
```

### Todo:

* Make this generate images that can be analysed.
* Make the fourier analysis side of the code.
* Make this work elliptically instead of just linearly.

## Report

A small start has also been made on a section of the [report](latex/project.pdf),
although headings and sectioning hasn't been started.
